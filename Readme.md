This project is for aws Infrastructure as Code(IaC) interactive workshops.

# What is IaC

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

# Why IaC

So you receive this unpleasant notification that a server is unreachable. You follow your usual quick fix routines (for example: flip through the logs to see what has happened), only to find out that the server has actually crashed. You freeze! Immediately, you get flashbacks of the hustle that you had to go through while trying to configure that server. You try to recall every component you had installed on the dead machine, plus their versions. It strikes you that you cannot even recall the order in which everything was installed, along with the nitty gritty.

# Workshops

## Workshop 1: Deploy your first application on IaC

During this workshop, we will deploy **node-playground** to Elastic Beanstalk docker stack. Basic understanding of docker needed.
